[  +10 ms] Warning: Flutter support for your project's Gradle version (8.5.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Gradle version to a version of at least 8.7.0 soon.
[  +17 ms] Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.
[   +4 ms] Potential fix: Your project's gradle version is typically defined in the gradle wrapper file. By default, this can be found at /home/rafiq/flutter_app/OneApp/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. 
[   +4 ms] For more information, see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html.
[        ] Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.2.1) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.6.0 soon.
[        ] Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.
[        ] Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/home/rafiq/flutter_app/OneApp/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
[   +6 ms] If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version.
