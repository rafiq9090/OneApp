[   +3 ms] Warning: Flutter support for your project's Gradle version (8.5.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Gradle version to a version of at least 8.7.0 soon.
[   +6 ms] Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.
[        ] Potential fix: Your project's gradle version is typically defined in the gradle wrapper file. By default, this can be found at /home/rafiq/flutter_app/OneApp/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. 
[        ] For more information, see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html.
